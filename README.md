### ‚ú® Features

* **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts elegantly to different screen sizes. On small screens, categories are presented in a horizontal, scrollable list, while on larger screens, they are displayed in a clean grid.
* **Dynamic Filtering**: Search functionality allows users to filter food items in real-time based on their input, providing instant results.
* **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is built with reusable React components, such as `FoodCard` and `Category`, making the codebase modular and easy to maintain.
* **Consistent UI Elements**: Food cards are standardized to a consistent size and aspect ratio, ensuring a uniform and visually appealing layout regardless of the food image dimensions.
* **Fixed Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the viewport for easy access to search and other options, even when the user is scrolling.
